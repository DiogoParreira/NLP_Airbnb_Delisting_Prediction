# NLP_Airbnb_Delisting_Predictions

The goal of this project is to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to predict whether a property listed on Airbnb will be unlisted in the next quarter. For this, we will
resort to real Airbnb property descriptions, Airbnb host descriptions, and comments from previous guests.
